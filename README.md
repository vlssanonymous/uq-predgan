# GAN-based Reduced Order Model for Prediction, Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification

This repository is the official implementation of: 

***A GAN-based Reduced Order Model for Prediction, Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification*** ICML submitted paper.

## Directories:

- **datasets**: Datasets of the spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19 in an idealized town. 
- **GAN_evaluation**: New way of evaluating the GAN training. 
- **Regularization**: Regularization to improve the GAN-based Reduced Order Model. 
- **UQ-PredGAN**: Data assimilation and uncertainty quantification using a GAN-based Reduced Order Model.

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
 $ conda env create -f environment.yml 
 $ conda activate py3ml
 $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3
```

Finally, start Jupyter:

```start
 $ jupyter notebook
```
## Codes

The codes and running instructions are in the directories **UQ-PredGAN**
